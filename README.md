This repo contains my starter scripts for the game Screeps, a fun side project for practicing JavaScript and playing with AI principles. 

Future versions will include various phases of growth deployment with switches to enable them as a colony progresses. 

The local dev environment was built for Visual Studio Code using sfrommer's template (link to his work below)

Gulp is used to push the local scripts to the Screeps client folder.
